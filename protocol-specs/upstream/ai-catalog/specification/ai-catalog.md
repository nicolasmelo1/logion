# Introduction

The AI ecosystem comprises a growing number of protocols, artifact
formats, and service types. Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers,
Agent-to-Agent (A2A) agents, Claude Code plugins, datasets, model cards,
and other AI artifacts each define their own metadata and discovery
mechanisms. This fragmentation forces clients and registries to
implement bespoke logic for each artifact type, increasing complexity
and reducing interoperability.

This document defines the **AI Catalog**: a typed, nestable JSON
container for discovering heterogeneous AI artifacts. Each entry
declares its artifact type via a media type and may reference or
embed the native artifact metadata. A minimal catalog is simply a
list of entries — names, types, and URLs — requiring no additional
infrastructure.

For environments that need verifiable identity, compliance evidence,
or provenance tracking, this document also defines an optional **Trust
Manifest** extension. A Trust Manifest accompanies an artifact as a
peer element, carrying attestations and provenance metadata without
wrapping or modifying the artifact's native format. Implementations
that do not need trust metadata can ignore the Trust Manifest entirely.

The AI Catalog is intentionally agnostic about the artifacts it
indexes. It does not define or constrain the schema of MCP server
manifests, A2A agent cards, or any other artifact format. Instead, it
relies on media types to identify what each entry is, and delegates
the definition of artifact-specific metadata to the respective protocol
specifications.

## Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
"OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
BCP 14 [[RFC2119]] [[RFC8174]] when, and only when, they appear in all
capitals, as shown here.

The following terms are used throughout this document:

AI Catalog
: A JSON document conforming to the `application/ai-catalog+json`
  media type that contains an ordered list of catalog entries.

Catalog Entry
: A single item in an AI Catalog, identified by a media type and
  referencing or embedding an AI artifact.

Trust Manifest
: A JSON object providing verifiable identity, attestation, and
  provenance metadata for an AI artifact.

Artifact
: Any AI resource described by a catalog entry, such as an MCP server
  manifest, an A2A agent card, a Claude Code plugin, a
  dataset descriptor, or a nested AI Catalog.

# Design Goals

1. **Artifact Agnosticism**: The catalog MUST be capable of indexing
   any type of AI artifact without requiring knowledge of the
   artifact's internal schema.

2. **Media Type Identification**: Each catalog entry MUST declare its
   artifact type using a media type, enabling clients to select,
   filter, and route entries without parsing artifact content.

3. **Composability**: The catalog format supports nesting — a catalog
   entry can reference another AI Catalog, enabling hierarchical
   organization and multi-artifact packaging.

4. **Progressive Complexity**: The simplest catalog is just entries
   with names and URLs. Trust, identity, and provenance metadata are
   available as optional extensions that never modify the catalog
   structure or artifact formats.

5. **Scalable Federation**: The catalog format enables partitioning
   into sub-catalogs to manage size, and supports delegation to
   sub-catalogs managed by independent publishers. Nested catalog
   entries support a federated model where each segment of the
   hierarchy may be authored, hosted, and updated independently.

6. **Location Independence**: An AI Catalog MAY be served from any URL.
   The standard defines a well-known URL convention to enable
   automated discovery, but catalogs are equally valid when hosted at
   arbitrary paths, embedded in registries, or distributed as files.

# AI Catalog

## Media Type

An AI Catalog document is identified by the media type:

    application/ai-catalog+json

## Top-Level Structure

An AI Catalog document is a JSON object that MUST contain the following
members:

`specVersion`
: A string indicating the version of this specification that the
  catalog conforms to, in "Major.Minor" format (e.g., "1.0").
  See [Version Handling](#version-handling) for compatibility rules.

`entries`
: An array of Catalog Entry objects as defined in [Catalog Entry](#catalog-entry).
  This array MAY be empty.

For example, a minimal catalog listing three AI artifacts:

```json
{
  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "entries": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:example.com:skill:code-review",
      "displayName": "Code Review Assistant",
      "type": "application/agent-skills+zip",
      "url": "https://skills.example.com/code-review/skill.zip"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:example.com:mcp:weather",
      "type": "application/mcp-server-card+json",
      "url": "https://api.example.com/mcp/server-card"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:example.com:a2a:research",
      "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
      "url": "https://agents.example.com/researchAssistant"
    }
  ]
}
```

The following members are OPTIONAL:

`host`
: A Host Info object as defined in [Host Info](#host-info) identifying the
  operator of this catalog.

`metadata`
: An open map of string keys to arbitrary values for custom or
  non-standard metadata. See [Metadata Extensibility](#metadata-extensibility)
  for key naming conventions.

## Host Info

The Host Info object identifies the operator of the catalog. It MUST
contain:

`displayName`
: A string containing the human-readable name of the host (e.g., the
  organization name).

The following members are OPTIONAL:

`identifier`
: A string containing a verifiable identifier for the host (e.g., a
  DID or domain name).

`documentationUrl`
: A string containing a URL to the host's documentation.

`logoUrl`
: A string containing a URL to the host's logo.

`trustManifest`
: A Trust Manifest object as defined in [Trust Manifest](#trust-manifest) providing
  verifiable identity and trust metadata for the host itself.

For example:

```json
{
  "displayName": "Acme Enterprise AI",
  "identifier": "did:web:acme-corp.com",
  "documentationUrl": "https://docs.acme-corp.com/ai",
  "logoUrl": "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0c..."
}
```

## Catalog Entry

A Catalog Entry object describes a single AI artifact in the catalog.
It MUST contain the following members:

`identifier`
: A string uniquely identifying this artifact. This field is an open text format (e.g., any valid URI or URN is accepted). However, to ensure interoperability, identity uniqueness, and discoverability, the standard `urn:air` naming structure is **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** and **MUST** be used for open or federated systems.

    **Standard Naming Format:**
    `urn:air:{publisher}:{namespace}:{name}`

    - `{publisher}`: The domain name of the organization publishing the artifact (e.g., `example.com`).
    - `{namespace}`: The logical namespace, which can contain one or more colon-separated categories (e.g., `mcp`, `skill`, `agent`, `finance:agent`).
    - `{name}`: The stable, unique name of the artifact within the publisher's namespace.

    *Examples:*

    - `urn:air:example.com:skill:code-review`
    - `urn:air:example.com:mcp:weather`

    For closed or local systems where a different identifier format is used, client implementations are responsible for parsing and processing the custom format as appropriate.

    See [Multi-Version Entries](#multi-version-entries) for uniqueness rules when multiple versions are present.

`type`
: A string containing the identifier that specifies the type of the
  referenced artifact. This field is an open text format, so any string value is accepted. However, to ensure interoperability, it is RECOMMENDED to use one of the following recognized "known types" in the ecosystem when applicable, partitioned by their respective governance boundaries:

    **Core Protocol Types (Governed by the AI Catalog WG):**

    - `application/ai-catalog+json` — a nested AI Catalog
    - `application/agent-card+json` — reserved for a generic Agent Card format

    **Integrated Ecosystem & Third-Party Types (Governed externally):**

    - `application/a2a-agent-card+json` — an A2A Agent Card
    - `application/mcp-server-card+json` — an MCP Server Card
    - `application/agent-skills+json` — Agent Skill Metadata json file
    - `application/agent-skills+md` — an Agent Skill defined in a standard Markdown file (the suffix `+md` is to be registered)
    - `application/agent-skills+zip` — an Agent Skill bundle (ZIP archive)
    - `application/agent-skills+gzip` — an Agent Skill bundle (gzipped tarball)

    These values are designed to align with official IANA media type registration standards. Standard ecosystem types use registered structured syntax suffixes (`+json`, `+zip`, `+gzip`). For any new or custom types not listed here, it is up to the specific client implementation to handle them correctly.

A Catalog Entry MUST contain exactly one of the following members to
provide the artifact content:

`url`
: A string containing a URL where the full artifact document can be
  retrieved. The document served at this URL SHOULD be served with
  the media type declared in the `type` field.

`data`
: A JSON value containing the complete artifact document inline. The
  structure of this value is determined by the `type` field and
  is opaque to this specification.

The following members are OPTIONAL:

`displayName`
: A string containing a human-readable name for the artifact.
  This field SHOULD be set only when the referenced artifact does not
  already carry its own canonical human-readable name — for example a
  raw dataset (`application/parquet`), a model blob, or a skill bundle
  (`application/agent-skills+zip`), none of which embed a self-describing
  name. When the referenced artifact does carry such a name — for
  example the `name` field of an A2A Agent Card or the `title` field of
  an MCP Server Card — that artifact is the authoritative source and
  `displayName` SHOULD be omitted to avoid duplicating a value that can
  drift out of sync. When `displayName` *is* present, however, it takes
  precedence: it is the authoritative value for display, and a consumer
  SHOULD render it as given even when it differs from a name carried by
  the referenced artifact. Setting `displayName` is how a publisher
  deliberately overrides the artifact's own name. See
  [Resolving an Artifact's Display Name](#resolving-an-artifact-s-display-name)
  for the full consumer resolution order.

`description`
: A string containing a short description of the artifact.

`tags`
: An array of strings serving as keywords for filtering and discovery.

`version`
: A string containing the version of this artifact.
  [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) is RECOMMENDED but not
  required. See [Multi-Version Entries](#multi-version-entries) for
  how versions interact with `identifier`.

`updatedAt`
: A string containing an ISO 8601 [[RFC3339]] timestamp indicating
  when this entry was last modified.

`metadata`
: An open map of string keys to arbitrary values for custom data.

`publisher`
: A Publisher object as defined in [Publisher Object](#publisher-object)
  identifying the entity that publishes this artifact. This is the
  sole location for publisher information; it is not duplicated in
  the Trust Manifest.

`trustManifest`
: A Trust Manifest object as defined in [Trust Manifest](#trust-manifest)
  providing verifiable identity and trust metadata for this artifact.
  See [Trust Manifest](#trust-manifest) for details.

### Resolving an Artifact's Display Name

Because `displayName` is OPTIONAL, a consumer rendering a catalog entry
cannot assume it is present. To obtain a human-readable name, a consumer
SHOULD resolve one in the following order:

1. **`displayName` on the entry**, if present. A publisher-supplied
   `displayName` always wins, even when it differs from a name carried by
   the referenced artifact.
2. **The referenced artifact's own canonical name**, if the consumer has
   already fetched or cached the artifact — for example the `name` field
   of an A2A Agent Card or the `title` field of an MCP Server Card.
3. **The trailing segment of the entry's `identifier`** as a last
   resort — the portion after its final `:` or `/` delimiter. For
   example, `urn:air:example.com:mcp:weather` yields `weather` and
   `urn:air:anonymous.modelcontextprotocol.io:mcp:brave-search` yields
   `brave-search`.

A consumer SHOULD NOT dereference an artifact at render time solely to
obtain a name. A registry, directory, or other service built on top of a
catalog SHOULD resolve the name once at ingestion — alongside any other
derived metadata it attaches, such as relevance scores or tags — and
cache the result, rather than fetching artifacts on the rendering path.

This order also covers a referenced MCP Server Card whose `title` is
itself absent: step 2 yields no name, so the consumer falls through to
the `identifier` segment in step 3. A publisher MAY still set
`displayName` on such an entry to provide a better name than the bare
identifier segment.

## Multi-Version Entries

A catalog MAY contain multiple entries with the same `identifier` and
different `version` values, representing a version history for a
single artifact — similar to a package registry.

When `version` is present, the combination of `identifier` and `version`
MUST be unique within the catalog. When `version` is absent, `identifier`
alone MUST be unique. The `identifier` SHOULD be stable across versions
and catalog locations so that the same logical artifact can be
recognized wherever it appears.

Clients that need only the latest version SHOULD sort entries
sharing the same `identifier` by `version` (when parseable as a semantic
version) or by `updatedAt`, and select the most recent. Clients
that need a specific version SHOULD match on both `identifier` and `version`.

For example, a catalog listing two versions of the same agent:

```json
{
  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "entries": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:agent:finance",
      "version": "2.1.0",
      "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
      "url": "https://api.acme-corp.com/agents/finance/v2.1.json",
      "updatedAt": "2026-03-15T10:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:agent:finance",
      "version": "2.0.0",
      "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
      "url": "https://api.acme-corp.com/agents/finance/v2.0.json",
      "updatedAt": "2026-01-20T08:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Both entries share the same `identifier` but have distinct `version`
values, so the combination is unique.

## Publisher Object

The Publisher object identifies the entity responsible for an artifact.
It appears on the Catalog Entry and is the canonical location for
publisher information. It MUST contain:

`identifier`
: A string containing a verifiable identifier for the publisher
  organization.

`displayName`
: A string containing the human-readable name of the publisher.

The following members are OPTIONAL:

`identityType`
: A string providing a type hint for the publisher identifier (e.g.,
  "did", "dns").

# Trust Manifest

The Trust Manifest is an OPTIONAL companion to catalog entries and
host objects. It is a JSON object that provides verifiable identity,
attestation, and provenance metadata for AI artifacts.
Implementations that do not require trust metadata MAY ignore this
section entirely — a conformant AI Catalog does not require Trust
Manifests.

The Trust Manifest does NOT wrap the artifact. It sits alongside the
artifact as a peer element within a Catalog Entry, keeping the native
artifact format unmodified. Publisher information is NOT duplicated
in the Trust Manifest — the informational publisher identity is
carried on the Catalog Entry (see [Publisher Object](#publisher-object)).

## Identity

A Trust Manifest MUST contain:

`identity`
: A string containing a globally unique URI [[RFC3986]] that serves as
  the primary subject identifier for this artifact. This SHOULD be a
  DID, SPIFFE ID, or URL; these are illustrative and the set of
  identity schemes is open.

When a Trust Manifest appears within a Catalog Entry, the `identity`
field's authority or trust domain MUST align with the publisher domain segment of
the entry's URN `identifier` field. This binding ensures trust claims are
cryptographically bound to the authorized publisher of the catalog entry.
Consumers MUST reject a Trust Manifest whose identity domain does not
align with the publisher domain of the entry's `identifier`.

When a Trust Manifest appears on a Host Info object, `identity`
SHOULD match the host's `identifier` field when present.

When multiple entries share the same `identifier` (with different `version`
values), each entry MAY carry its own Trust Manifest. There is no
requirement that all versions carry identical trust metadata — trust
properties may evolve across versions.

## Optional Members

The following members are OPTIONAL:

`identityType`
: A string providing a type hint for the identity URI (e.g., "did",
  "spiffe", "dns"). This field is OPTIONAL when the type is evident
  from the URI scheme.

`trustSchema`
: A Trust Schema object as defined in [Trust Schema](#trust-schema-object).

`attestations`
: An array of Attestation objects as defined in [Attestation](#attestation-object).
  This is the mechanism for verifiable claims including publisher
  identity verification (using attestation type "publisher-identity"),
  compliance certifications, and other proofs.

`provenance`
: An array of Provenance Link objects as defined in
  [Provenance Link](#provenance-link-object).

`privacyPolicyUrl`
: A string containing a URL to the privacy policy governing this
  artifact.

`termsOfServiceUrl`
: A string containing a URL to the terms of service.

`signature`
: A string containing a detached JWS [[RFC7515]] signature computed
  over the Trust Manifest content. This enables integrity verification
  of the trust metadata independent of the artifact.

`metadata`
: An open map of string keys to arbitrary values for extending trust
  metadata.

For example, a Trust Manifest with identity, attestations, and
provenance:

```json
{
  "identity": "did:web:acme.com:agent:finance",
  "identityType": "did",
  "trustSchema": {
    "identifier": "urn:trust:acme-enterprise-v1",
    "version": "1.0",
    "governanceUri": "https://acme-corp.com/trust/governance.pdf",
    "verificationMethods": ["did", "x509"]
  },
  "attestations": [
    {
      "type": "publisher-identity",
      "uri": "https://trust.acme-corp.com/certs/publisher.jwt",
      "description": "Verifies did:web:acme-corp.com as publisher"
    },
    {
      "type": "SOC2-Type2",
      "uri": "https://trust.acme-corp.com/reports/soc2.pdf",
      "digest": "sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f67890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890"
    }
  ],
  "provenance": [
    {
      "relation": "publishedFrom",
      "sourceId": "https://github.com/acme-corp/finance-agent",
      "sourceDigest": "sha256:fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321"
    }
  ],
  "privacyPolicyUrl": "https://acme-corp.com/legal/privacy",
  "termsOfServiceUrl": "https://acme-corp.com/legal/terms",
  "signature": "eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiJ9..detached-jws-signature"
}
```

## Trust Schema Object

A Trust Schema object describes the trust framework applied to the
artifact. It MUST contain:

`identifier`
: A string identifying the trust schema.

`version`
: A string indicating the schema version.

The following members are OPTIONAL:

`governanceUri`
: A string containing a URI to the governance policy document.

`verificationMethods`
: An array of strings identifying the verification methods supported
  (e.g., "did", "x509", "dns-01").

For example:

```json
{
  "identifier": "urn:trust:acme-enterprise-v1",
  "version": "1.0",
  "governanceUri": "https://acme-corp.com/trust/governance.pdf",
  "verificationMethods": ["did", "x509"]
}
```

## Attestation Object

An Attestation object provides verifiable proof of a claim. It MUST
contain:

`type`
: A string identifying the attestation type (e.g., "SOC2-Type2",
  "HIPAA-Audit", "ISO27001").

`uri`
: A string containing the location of the attestation document.
  This may be an HTTPS URL or an inline Data URI [[RFC2397]].

The following members are OPTIONAL:

`digest`
: A string containing a cryptographic hash for integrity verification
  (e.g., "sha256:abcd1234...").

`size`
: An unsigned integer indicating the size of the attestation in bytes.

`description`
: A string containing a human-readable label.

For example, a compliance attestation with integrity verification:

```json
{
  "type": "SOC2-Type2",
  "uri": "https://trust.acme-corp.com/reports/soc2-2026.pdf",
  "digest": "sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f67890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890",
  "size": 245760,
  "description": "SOC2 Type 2 audit report for Acme Finance Agent (2026)"
}
```

## Provenance Link Object

A Provenance Link records lineage information. It MUST contain:

`relation`
: A string describing the relationship (e.g., "materializedFrom",
  "derivedFrom", "publishedFrom").

`sourceId`
: A string identifying the source artifact or data.

The following members are OPTIONAL:

`sourceDigest`
: A string containing the digest of the source.

`registryUri`
: A string containing the URI of the registry holding the source.

`statementUri`
: A string containing the URI of a provenance statement document.

`signatureRef`
: A string referencing the key used to sign the provenance statement.

For example, a provenance link recording that an artifact was built
from a specific source commit and published through an OCI registry:

```json
{
  "relation": "publishedFrom",
  "sourceId": "https://github.com/acme-corp/finance-agent",
  "sourceDigest": "sha256:fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321fedcba0987654321",
  "registryUri": "oci://registry.acme-corp.com/agents/finance",
  "statementUri": "https://trust.acme-corp.com/provenance/finance-agent-v2.1.json",
  "signatureRef": "did:web:acme-corp.com#key-1"
}
```

## Verification Procedures

This section describes how consumers verify the trust metadata
carried by a Trust Manifest. Verification is OPTIONAL — consumers
that do not need trust assurance can skip this entirely.

### Digest Format

Digests in this specification use the format `algorithm:hex-value`,
where `algorithm` is a hash algorithm identifier and `hex-value` is
the lowercase hexadecimal encoding of the hash output. For example:

    sha256:9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015a3bf4f1b2b0b822cd15d6c15b0f00a08

Producers SHOULD use SHA-256 [[RFC6234]] or stronger. Consumers
MUST reject digest values using algorithms shorter than SHA-256.

### Trust Manifest Signatures

The `signature` field carries a detached JWS [[RFC7515]] computed
over the Trust Manifest content. To create or verify a signature:

1. **Canonicalize** the Trust Manifest JSON using JCS (JSON
   Canonicalization Scheme) [[RFC8785]]. Remove the `signature`
   field itself before canonicalization.
2. **Sign** (or verify) the canonical bytes as a detached JWS
   payload using the publisher's private (or public) key.
3. **Encode** the resulting JWS in compact serialization and store
   it in the `signature` field.

This approach ensures the signature is stable regardless of JSON
key ordering or whitespace, and can be verified independently of the
artifact content.

### Key Resolution

Consumers resolve the signer's public key based on the `identity`
URI scheme:

DID (e.g., `did:web:example.com`)
: Resolve the DID Document per the relevant DID method specification
  and extract the verification key from the `verificationMethod`
  array.

HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://example.com/.well-known/jwks.json`)
: Fetch the JWK Set [[RFC7517]] at the specified URL and select the
  key matching the JWS `kid` header.

SPIFFE ID (e.g., `spiffe://example.com/service`)
: Obtain the X.509 SVID from the SPIFFE Workload API and extract
  the public key from the leaf certificate.

DNS
: Resolve the domain's TLS certificate and extract the public key,
  or look up a DNSKEY/TXT record containing the JWK thumbprint.

### Verifying Host Identity

To verify the host of a catalog:

1. Confirm the catalog was retrieved over HTTPS from the expected
   domain.
2. If `host.identifier` is a DID, resolve the DID Document and confirm the
   hosting domain appears in the DID Document's `service` endpoints.
3. If `host.trustManifest` is present and signed, verify the
   signature as described above.

### Verifying Publisher Identity

To verify the publisher of an artifact:

1. Locate the `publisher-identity` attestation in the Trust
   Manifest's `attestations` array.
2. Fetch the attestation document (typically a JWT) from the `uri`.
3. Verify the JWT signature against the publisher's public key
   (resolved from `publisher.identifier`).
4. Confirm the JWT claims bind the `publisher.identifier` to the Trust
   Manifest's `identity`.

### Verifying Artifact Integrity

When a Trust Manifest includes `provenance` entries with `sourceDigest`:

1. Fetch the artifact content from the entry's `url`.
2. Compute the digest using the algorithm specified in the
   `sourceDigest` field.
3. Compare the computed digest to the declared value. Reject the
   artifact if they differ.

### Verifying Attestations

For each attestation in the `attestations` array:

1. Fetch the attestation document from `uri`.
2. If `digest` is present, verify the fetched document matches the
   declared digest.
3. Validate the attestation per its `type` (e.g., verify a JWT
   signature, confirm a PDF certificate is current).

# Organizing Catalogs

As catalogs grow, a flat list of entries becomes unwieldy. Because any
catalog entry can have a `type` of `application/ai-catalog+json`,
catalogs are naturally composable — an entry can reference or inline
another AI Catalog, creating a hierarchy of any depth.

## Nested Catalog Entries

A catalog entry whose `type` is `application/ai-catalog+json`
references (via `url`) or embeds (via `data`) another AI Catalog
document. This mechanism supports two complementary use cases:

**Organizational hierarchy.** An enterprise with thousands of artifacts
can partition its catalog into sub-catalogs by department, product line,
or region. Each sub-catalog is an independent AI Catalog document with
its own `host` and entries:

```json
{
  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "host": {
    "displayName": "Acme Enterprise AI",
    "identifier": "did:web:acme-corp.com"
  },
  "entries": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:catalog:finance",
      "displayName": "Finance Services",
      "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
      "url": "https://acme.com/catalogs/finance.json"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:catalog:ml",
      "displayName": "ML Models",
      "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
      "url": "https://acme.com/catalogs/ml.json"
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:catalog:devops",
      "displayName": "DevOps Tools",
      "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
      "url": "https://acme.com/catalogs/devops.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Multi-artifact packaging.** An entry with a `publisher` that contains
a nested catalog may be interpreted as a set of items that could be
acquired as a unit. For example, a finance plugin that ships an A2A
agent, an MCP server, and a dataset together:

```json
{
  "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:plugin:finance-suite",
  "displayName": "Finance Plugin",
  "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
  "url": "https://acme.com/plugins/finance-suite.json",
  "publisher": {
    "identifier": "did:web:acme-corp.com",
    "displayName": "Acme Financial Corp"
  }
}
```

The document at that URL would itself be an AI Catalog containing
the A2A agent, MCP server, and dataset entries.

A nested catalog entry is a regular catalog entry — it has an
`identifier`, may carry a `trustManifest`, and may include a
`publisher`. An entry inside a nested catalog MAY reuse the same
`identifier` as an entry elsewhere; this indicates the same logical
artifact.

Clients processing nested catalogs SHOULD impose a maximum nesting
depth to prevent circular references. A depth limit of 4 is
RECOMMENDED. Implementations MAY support deeper nesting but SHOULD
document their limit.

# Metadata Extensibility

The `metadata` property appears on the AI Catalog top-level object,
on Catalog Entry objects, and on Trust Manifest objects. It provides
a single, well-defined extension point for custom or vendor-specific
properties.

## Key Naming

Metadata keys MUST be non-empty strings. To avoid collisions between
independent publishers, the following conventions are RECOMMENDED:

- **Reverse-DNS prefix** for vendor-specific keys:
  `com.example.confidenceScore`, `io.acme.deploymentRegion`.
- **Short, unqualified names** for keys the publisher considers
  broadly useful and unlikely to conflict: `repository`, `homepage`,
  `license`.
- **Avoid keys that duplicate** defined catalog fields (`displayName`,
  `description`, `tags`, `version`). Consumers MAY ignore metadata
  entries that shadow standard fields.

## Reserved Keys

No metadata keys are reserved by this specification. Future
specification versions MAY promote commonly used metadata keys into
standard fields. When this occurs, the metadata key SHOULD be
retained for backward compatibility and the standard field takes
precedence.

## Value Types

Metadata values MAY be any valid JSON type (string, number, boolean,
array, object, null). Consumers that do not recognize a metadata key
SHOULD ignore it.

# Version Handling

The `specVersion` field identifies which version of this specification
a catalog conforms to. This section defines how producers and consumers
handle version differences.

## Version Format

The `specVersion` value is a "Major.Minor" string (e.g., "1.0",
"1.1", "2.0"). Major and minor components are non-negative integers.

## Compatibility Rules

Minor version increments (e.g., 1.0 → 1.1)
: The specification adds new OPTIONAL fields or features. Documents
  conforming to a higher minor version are backward-compatible with
  consumers that understand the same major version. Consumers MUST
  ignore unrecognized fields.

Major version increments (e.g., 1.x → 2.0)
: The specification introduces breaking changes (removed fields,
  changed semantics, new required fields). Consumers that do not
  support the major version SHOULD reject the document with an
  informative error rather than silently misinterpreting it.

## Consumer Behavior

Consumers SHOULD:

- Parse the `specVersion` field before processing the document.
- Accept documents whose major version matches their supported major
  version, regardless of minor version differences.
- Ignore unrecognized fields (forward compatibility within a major
  version).
- Reject documents whose major version is higher than the highest
  major version they support, with an informative error message.

## Producer Behavior

Producers MUST set `specVersion` to the version of this specification
they implement. Producers SHOULD NOT set `specVersion` to a version
higher than they actually conform to.

# Discovery

## Location Independence

An AI Catalog document MAY be served from any URL. It is identified
by its media type (`application/ai-catalog+json`) and its `specVersion`
field, not by its URL path. Catalogs are equally valid when hosted at
an arbitrary path, embedded in a registry response, packaged in an
archive, or distributed as a local file.

When served over HTTP, the document SHOULD be served with the media
type `application/ai-catalog+json`.

## Well-Known URI

To support automated discovery, hosts MAY serve an AI Catalog at the
following well-known URI [[RFC8615]]:

    /.well-known/ai-catalog.json

Clients performing domain-level discovery SHOULD attempt to retrieve
this well-known URL. If a valid AI Catalog document is returned, the
client SHOULD use the entries' `url` values to retrieve individual
artifacts. Trust metadata, when present, is carried inline on the
entries as Trust Manifests.

Use of the well-known URI is OPTIONAL. Hosts that publish catalogs at
other locations (e.g., as part of an API response or a package
registry) are fully conformant.

## Dynamic Discovery

Implementing protocols MAY support dynamic catalog generation through
their own mechanisms, such as providing different catalog content based
on a caller's identity or query parameters. Defining dynamic discovery
behavior is out of scope for this specification.

## Link Relation Discovery

Websites MAY advertise their AI Catalog by including an `ai-catalog`
link relation in HTTP responses or HTML documents. This enables AI
agents, crawlers, and other automated clients to discover the catalog
associated with any website without prior knowledge of its location.

**HTTP Link header.** A server MAY include a `Link` header [[RFC8288]]
in HTTP responses:

    Link: <https://example.com/catalog/ai.json>; rel="ai-catalog"

**HTML `<link>` element.** An HTML page MAY include a link element in
the document head:

```html
<link rel="ai-catalog" href="/catalog/ai.json"
      type="application/ai-catalog+json">
```

**Agent-driven discovery.** AI agents that interact with websites
(for example, agents following user instructions to "find tools on
this site" or browsing on behalf of a user) SHOULD check for the
`ai-catalog` link relation on the target website. The discovery
procedure is:

1. Fetch the target URL and inspect the HTTP response headers for
   a `Link` header with `rel="ai-catalog"`.
2. If no `Link` header is present and the response is an HTML
   document, parse the document for a `<link>` element with
   `rel="ai-catalog"`.
3. If neither is found, optionally fall back to the well-known URI
   `/.well-known/ai-catalog.json` as described in
   [Well-Known URI](#well-known-uri).
4. Retrieve the discovered URL. If the response has a media type of
   `application/ai-catalog+json` and contains a valid `specVersion`
   field, treat it as the site's AI Catalog.

This mechanism allows any website to surface its AI tools, agents,
and services to visiting agents through a standard, machine-readable
pointer — without requiring changes to the site's visible content.

# Conformance Levels

This specification defines three conformance levels. Each level builds
on the previous one. Implementations MUST satisfy all requirements of
their declared level.

## Level 1: Minimal Catalog

A conformant Minimal Catalog is a JSON document with media type
`application/ai-catalog+json` that contains:

- `specVersion` — the specification version string
- `entries` — an array of Catalog Entry objects, each containing at
  minimum `identifier`, `type`, and exactly one of `url` or
  `data`

All other fields (`host`, `publisher`, `trustManifest`,
`metadata`) are OPTIONAL. This level is sufficient for use cases that
only need a simple list of AI artifacts — for example, a catalog of
MCP servers or A2A agents.

## Level 2: Discoverable Catalog

In addition to Level 1 requirements, a Discoverable Catalog:

- Includes a `host` object identifying the catalog operator
- MAY be served at the well-known URI `/.well-known/ai-catalog.json`
  to enable automated domain-level discovery

## Level 3: Trusted Catalog

In addition to Level 2 requirements, a Trusted Catalog:

- Includes `trustManifest` objects on entries and/or the host, as
  defined in [Trust Manifest](#trust-manifest)
- MAY include `publisher` objects on entries with verifiable identifiers
- Enables verifiable identity, compliance attestations, and provenance
  tracking

Implementations at any level are fully conformant with this
specification. Consumers MAY ignore fields defined at higher
conformance levels and SHOULD gracefully handle their absence.

# Security Considerations

## Trust Layers

This specification supports a progressive trust model. Each layer
builds on the previous one, adding confidence without requiring all
consumers to implement every layer. Consumers choose the level
appropriate to their threat model.

**Layer 0 — Transport Security**
: The catalog and artifacts are served over HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or later).
  The consumer trusts the TLS certificate chain and DNS resolution.
  This prevents passive eavesdropping and casual tampering but does
  not protect against compromised hosting or DNS hijack.

**Layer 1 — Trust Manifest with Provenance**
: The catalog entry includes a Trust Manifest containing provenance
  links with `sourceDigest` values. After fetching an artifact, the
  consumer can hash the content and compare it to the digest recorded
  in the provenance link. This detects artifact tampering in transit.
  However, because the Trust Manifest is a peer element in the catalog
  (not embedded in the artifact), an attacker who controls the catalog
  document can substitute both the artifact URL and the Trust Manifest
  with matching values. **Digest verification without signature
  verification guards against transport-level tampering but not
  catalog-level substitution.**

**Layer 2 — Signed Trust Manifest**
: The Trust Manifest includes a `signature` field (detached JWS).
  The consumer verifies the signature against the publisher's public
  key before trusting any claims in the Trust Manifest — including
  provenance digests, attestations, and identity bindings. This closes
  the substitution gap from Layer 1: an attacker cannot forge a
  signed Trust Manifest without the publisher's private key.
  Consumers SHOULD verify signatures when present and SHOULD reject
  Trust Manifests whose signature does not validate.

**Layer 3 — Content-Addressed Distribution (OCI)**
: The catalog is distributed through an OCI registry where all content
  — entries, artifacts, and Trust Manifests — is addressed by
  cryptographic digest. The registry enforces integrity: substitution
  is impossible because any change produces a different digest.
  Cosign or Notation signatures on OCI manifests provide an additional
  layer of publisher authentication.

Consumers that rely on trust metadata for security decisions SHOULD
implement at least Layer 2 (signature verification). Consumers that
only implement Layer 0 or Layer 1 SHOULD treat Trust Manifest content
as advisory, not authoritative.

## Nested Catalog Depth and Circular References

Clients processing nested catalogs SHOULD enforce a maximum recursion
depth to prevent denial-of-service attacks via deeply nested or
circular catalog references. A maximum depth of 4 is RECOMMENDED.

Depth limits alone do not prevent circular references at shallow
depths (e.g., Catalog A → Catalog B → Catalog A). Clients SHOULD
track the set of catalog URLs visited during recursive resolution and
reject any catalog URL that has already been fetched in the current
traversal path.

## Catalog Poisoning

An attacker who can modify a catalog document (e.g., through a
compromised hosting account or DNS hijack) can redirect consumers to
malicious artifacts by changing `url` values or injecting new entries.

The trust layers described above provide progressive defense against
this threat:

- **Layer 0** relies on HTTPS certificate management to prevent
  unauthorized modification.
- **Layer 1** enables post-fetch integrity checks but does not prevent
  whole-entry substitution.
- **Layer 2** prevents Trust Manifest forgery, ensuring provenance
  digests and attestations are authentic.
- **Layer 3** makes modification structurally impossible through
  content-addressing.

## Identifier Typosquatting

Catalog entries are identified by URIs/URNs. An attacker can register
identifiers similar to legitimate ones (e.g., `urn:air:acme.com:agent:financ`
vs. `urn:air:acme.com:agent:finance`) to trick consumers into using a
malicious artifact.

Registries and consumers SHOULD implement similarity checks on
identifiers. Publishers SHOULD use identifiers anchored to domains
they control (e.g., DIDs or domain-scoped URNs).

## Stale Attestations

Attestation documents referenced in Trust Manifests have no built-in
expiry mechanism in this specification. A SOC2 report from a previous
year may no longer reflect current practices.

Consumers SHOULD:

- Check the `updatedAt` field on catalog entries to assess freshness.
- Independently verify attestation documents are current when making
  trust decisions.
- Treat attestations as evidence, not guarantees — the attestation
  indicates a claim was made, not that it remains valid indefinitely.

Future versions of this specification MAY add `validFrom` and
`expiresAt` fields to the Attestation object.

## Embedded Content Safety

When the `data` field contains embedded artifact content, consumers
MUST treat it as untrusted input. In particular:

- Content with HTML or script-capable media types MUST be sandboxed
  and MUST NOT be executed in the consumer's security context.
- Consumers SHOULD validate that the `data` content is well-formed
  JSON (or the expected format for the declared `type`) before
  processing.

## Privacy Considerations

Logo URLs SHOULD use Data URIs [[RFC2397]] to avoid leaking client
information through image fetch requests. Publishers SHOULD carefully
consider what information is included in `metadata` extension fields.

# Example: Hierarchical Catalog

The following example shows how an enterprise uses nested catalog
entries to organize a large number of artifacts into browsable
categories. Each sub-catalog entry points to a separate AI Catalog
document:

```json
{
  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "host": {
    "displayName": "Acme Enterprise AI",
    "identifier": "did:web:acme-corp.com"
  },
  "entries": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:agent:assistant",
      "version": "3.0.0",
      "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
      "url": "https://api.acme-corp.com/agents/assistant.json",
      "description": "General-purpose corporate assistant agent."
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:catalog:finance",
      "displayName": "Finance Services",
      "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
      "url": "https://acme-corp.com/catalogs/finance.json",
      "description": "Financial agents, MCP servers, and datasets.",
      "tags": ["finance", "trading", "compliance"]
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:catalog:engineering",
      "displayName": "Engineering Tools",
      "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
      "url": "https://acme-corp.com/catalogs/engineering.json",
      "description": "CI/CD agents, code review tools, and DevOps servers.",
      "tags": ["engineering", "devops", "ci-cd"]
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:catalog:ml-models",
      "displayName": "ML Models",
      "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
      "url": "https://acme-corp.com/catalogs/ml-models.json",
      "description": "Model cards and inference endpoints.",
      "tags": ["ml", "models", "inference"]
    }
  ]
}
```

A catalog MAY contain both direct artifact entries and nested catalog
entries. In this example, the corporate assistant agent is listed
directly while department-specific artifacts are organized into child
catalogs.

# Example: Dual-Protocol Agent (MCP + A2A)

A single agent that supports both MCP and A2A protocols can be
represented as one catalog entry whose content is a nested catalog
containing both protocol-specific entries:

```json
{
  "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:agent:finance",
  "displayName": "Acme Finance Agent",
  "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
  "description": "Finance agent accessible via both MCP and A2A protocols.",
  "tags": ["finance", "dual-protocol"],
  "publisher": {
    "identifier": "did:web:acme-corp.com",
    "displayName": "Acme Financial Corp"
  },
  "data": {
    "specVersion": "1.0",
    "entries": [
      {
        "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:agent:finance:mcp",
        "type": "application/mcp-server-card+json",
        "url": "https://api.acme-corp.com/mcp/server-card"
      },
      {
        "identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:agent:finance:a2a",
        "type": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
        "url": "https://api.acme-corp.com/agents/finance"
      }
    ]
  },
  "trustManifest": {
    "identity": "spiffe://acme.com/ns/finance/sa/finance-agent-pod",
    "identityType": "spiffe",
    "attestations": [
      {
        "type": "SOC2-Type2",
        "uri": "https://trust.acme-corp.com/reports/soc2.pdf",
        "digest": "sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f67890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The outer entry represents the logical agent as a single discoverable
artifact with its own trust metadata. The `data` field inlines a
catalog with protocol-specific entries, allowing clients to choose
MCP or A2A based on their capabilities.

# Mapping to OCI Distribution

This appendix describes how AI Catalog documents can be distributed
through OCI registries, enabling content-addressed storage, signing,
and replication using existing container infrastructure.

## Logical Format vs. Physical Distribution

The AI Catalog specification defines a **logical format**: a JSON
document with `entries`, `displayName`, `type`, and `trustManifest`
fields that are immediately meaningful to anyone working with AI
artifacts. Authors write simple JSON. APIs serve simple JSON. Clients
consume simple JSON.

OCI provides a **physical distribution layer**: content-addressed
storage, cryptographic signing via Cosign/Notation, global replication
through registries, and referrer-based metadata association. These are
valuable infrastructure capabilities, but OCI's data model uses
container-oriented vocabulary (`manifests`, `layers`, `config`,
`digest`) that does not naturally describe a catalog of AI artifacts.

This specification treats OCI as one distribution option, not as the
canonical data model. The logical AI Catalog format remains the
authoring and consumption interface. Tooling bridges the two:

```
Authoring                         Distribution                    Consumption
─────────                         ────────────                    ───────────
ai-catalog.json    ──pack──►    OCI Registry     ──unpack──►   ai-catalog.json
  entries[]                       Index/Manifests                  entries[]
  trustManifest                   Referrers                        trustManifest
```

This separation means:

- **Simplicity for authors**: Publishers write AI Catalog JSON using
  domain vocabulary. No knowledge of OCI manifests, digests, or layer
  descriptors is required.
- **Simplicity for consumers**: Clients that fetch from
  `/.well-known/ai-catalog.json` or a registry API receive the logical
  JSON format. They never need to parse OCI structures.
- **Power for infrastructure**: Registries that want content-addressed
  integrity, signing, and replication can store catalogs as OCI
  artifacts using the mapping defined below.

## Conceptual Mapping

The OCI image specification (v1.1+) supports arbitrary artifact types
through the `artifactType` field. The following table maps AI Catalog
concepts to their OCI physical equivalents:

| AI Catalog (Logical) | OCI (Physical) |
|:---|:---|
| AI Catalog document | OCI Image Index with `artifactType: "application/ai-catalog+json"` |
| Catalog Entry | OCI Image Manifest with `artifactType` set to the entry's `type` |
| Entry `type` | Manifest `artifactType` field |
| Entry artifact content | Manifest `layers[0]` blob (the protocol-specific document) |
| Entry metadata (name, tags, publisher) | Manifest `config` blob and/or `annotations` |
| Nested Catalog Entry | Nested OCI Image Index referenced from the parent index |
| Trust Manifest | OCI Referrer artifact with `subject` pointing to the entry manifest |
| Trust Manifest attestations | Individual OCI Referrer artifacts per attestation |
| Signing | Cosign / Notation signatures as OCI Referrers |

## Packing: AI Catalog to OCI

Tooling converts an AI Catalog JSON document into OCI artifacts:

1. **Each catalog entry** becomes an OCI Image Manifest. The entry's
   artifact content (A2A card, MCP Server Card, skill definition) is
   stored as a `layers[0]` blob. Common metadata (name, description,
   publisher) is stored as the `config` blob or as `annotations`.

2. **The catalog itself** becomes an OCI Image Index whose `manifests`
   array references the per-entry manifests by digest.

3. **Trust Manifests** become OCI Referrer artifacts attached to their
   entry manifests via the `subject` field. Attestation documents
   (JWTs, PDFs, SLSA provenance) become individual referrer layers.

4. **Nested catalog entries** become nested OCI Image Indexes.

```
oci://registry.acme.com/ai-catalog:latest          (Image Index)
  ├── manifest: finance-a2a-agent                   (Manifest)
  │     ├── config: { name, description, publisher }
  │     ├── layers[0]: a2a-card.json
  │     └── referrer: trust-manifest                (Referrer)
  │           ├── config: trust-manifest.json
  │           └── layers: [publisher.jwt, soc2.pdf]
  ├── manifest: finance-mcp-server                  (Manifest)
  │     ├── config: { name, description }
  │     └── layers[0]: mcp-server.json
  └── index: finance-suite                          (Nested Index)
        ├── manifest: suite-a2a-agent
        └── manifest: suite-mcp-server
```

## Unpacking: OCI to AI Catalog

Tooling converts OCI artifacts back to an AI Catalog JSON document:

1. Fetch the OCI Image Index for the catalog.
2. For each manifest in the index, extract the `config` blob
   (entry metadata) and `layers[0]` blob (artifact content).
3. Query the Referrers API for each manifest to discover Trust
   Manifests and attestations.
4. Assemble the logical AI Catalog JSON with `entries[]` and
   `trustManifest` fields.

The result is a standard `application/ai-catalog+json` document
indistinguishable from one authored by hand.

## OCI Image Index Example

The following shows the OCI physical representation of an AI Catalog
containing two entries. Note that this is generated by tooling, not
authored by hand:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.index.v1+json",
  "artifactType": "application/ai-catalog+json",
  "manifests": [
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
      "digest": "sha256:aaa111...",
      "size": 1024,
      "artifactType": "application/a2a-agent-card+json",
      "annotations": {
        "ai-catalog.identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:agent:finance-a2a",
        "ai-catalog.displayName": "Acme Finance A2A Agent"
      }
    },
    {
      "mediaType": "application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json",
      "digest": "sha256:bbb222...",
      "size": 512,
      "artifactType": "application/mcp-server-card+json",
      "annotations": {
        "ai-catalog.identifier": "urn:air:acme.com:server:finance-mcp",
        "ai-catalog.displayName": "Acme Finance MCP Server"
      }
    }
  ],
  "annotations": {
    "ai-catalog.specVersion": "1.0",
    "ai-catalog.host.displayName": "Acme Services Inc."
  }
}
```

## Signing and Verification

Because OCI distribution uses content-addressed digests, signing is
handled by existing OCI tooling rather than embedded signature fields:

```
# Sign an entry manifest
cosign sign registry.example.com/ai/finance-a2a@sha256:aaa111...

# Verify
cosign verify registry.example.com/ai/finance-a2a@sha256:aaa111...

# Attach SLSA provenance
cosign attest --predicate provenance.json --type slsaprovenance \
  registry.example.com/ai/finance-a2a@sha256:aaa111...
```

These signatures and attestations are discoverable via the OCI
Referrers API and can be mapped back to Trust Manifest attestation
objects during unpacking.

## Relationship to OCI-Native Proposals

Some proposals (such as the AAIF AI Card OCI schema) take an
OCI-native approach where the OCI Image Manifest *is* the data model.
In that model, the AI Card is an OCI Manifest, protocol cards are
OCI layers, and the catalog is an OCI Image Index consumed directly.

This specification takes a different position: the logical JSON format
is the primary interface, and OCI is a distribution substrate. The
tradeoffs are:

| Concern | Logical-first (this spec) | OCI-native |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Authoring | Write simple JSON with domain vocabulary | Write JSON conforming to OCI Manifest schema |
| Vocabulary | `entries`, `displayName`, `type`, `trustManifest` | `manifests`, `layers`, `config`, `annotations` |
| Minimum viable serving | Static JSON file at any URL (optionally well-known) | OCI registry or static OCI layout |
| Signing | Detached JWS in logical format; Cosign/Notation in OCI | Cosign/Notation only |
| Content integrity | Optional digests in Trust Manifest | Guaranteed by OCI content-addressing |
| Ecosystem compatibility | Any HTTP server, any registry, any CDN | OCI-compliant registries |
| Adoption barrier | Low — familiar JSON | Higher — requires OCI familiarity |

Both approaches can coexist. A tooling bridge converts between them
losslessly, allowing simple consumers to work with the logical format
while infrastructure-oriented deployments leverage OCI distribution.

# Mapping to MCP Servers

This appendix describes how **remote (HTTP-connectable) MCP servers**
map to AI Catalog, enabling them to be discovered alongside other AI
artifacts through a unified catalog. The documented, supported path is
to reference each server's **MCP Server Card**
([SEP-2127](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2127))
as the artifact content of a Catalog Entry.

## Overview

An MCP Server Card is a static discovery document for an individual
HTTP-based MCP server, describing its identity and how to connect to it.
A Catalog Entry references the card wherever the server publishes it, as
in the examples below. See
[SEP-2127](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2127)
for the Server Card's schema, fields, and hosting conventions.

In AI Catalog terms, the Server Card is the **artifact content** — the
native metadata that a Catalog Entry references via its `url`, declared
with the known type `application/mcp-server-card+json`. The AI Catalog
does not duplicate or redefine Server Card fields; it provides the
discovery and trust layer that the Server Card does not address.

AI Catalog and MCP Server Cards address different layers of discovery:

MCP Server Card (per-server)
: What does this specific MCP server offer? What transport does it
  use? What tools and resources are available? What authentication
  is required?

AI Catalog (cross-artifact)
: What artifacts does this domain offer? Who published them? Can I
  trust them? What other artifact types are available alongside MCP
  servers?

## Conceptual Mapping

| MCP Server Card | AI Catalog Equivalent |
|:---|:---|
| Server Card document (whole file) | Artifact content via entry `url` (type `application/mcp-server-card+json`) or `data` |
| Server `name` (reverse-DNS identifier) | Entry `identifier` (mapped to the `urn:air:{publisher}:{namespace}:{name}` URN form — e.g. `urn:air:acme-corp.com:mcp:finance-server`) |
| `title` | Stays in the Server Card (which carries its own `title`); entry `displayName` is omitted unless the artifact lacks a name |
| `description` | Stays in the Server Card (which carries its own `description`); entry `description` is omitted to avoid duplicating a value that can drift |
| `version` | Stays in the Server Card (which carries its own `version`); entry `version` is omitted to avoid duplicating a value that can drift (a remote MCP server serves one Server Card, so a catalog never lists multiple versions of it) |
| transport / capabilities / tools / resources / auth | Inside the Server Card — not surfaced in the catalog |
| `repository` | Stays in the Server Card (which carries its own `repository`); omitted from the entry to avoid duplicating a value that can drift — catalog-level source/provenance links surface through the Trust Manifest when needed |
| *(not in the Server Card)* | Entry `publisher` |
| *(not in the Server Card)* | Entry `trustManifest` (identity, attestations, provenance) |
| *(not in the Server Card)* | Entry `tags` for cross-artifact discovery |

## MCP Server as Catalog Entry

A remote MCP server maps to a Catalog Entry whose `url` points to the
server's Server Card and whose `type` is the known type
`application/mcp-server-card+json`:

```json
{
  "identifier": "urn:air:acme-corp.com:mcp:finance-server",
  "type": "application/mcp-server-card+json",
  "url": "https://api.acme-corp.com/mcp/server-card",
  "tags": ["finance", "mcp"],
  "publisher": {
    "identifier": "did:web:acme-corp.com",
    "displayName": "Acme Financial Corp"
  },
  "trustManifest": {
    "identity": "urn:air:acme-corp.com:mcp:finance-server",
    "attestations": [
      {
        "type": "publisher-identity",
        "uri": "https://trust.acme-corp.com/certs/publisher.jwt"
      },
      {
        "type": "SOC2-Type2",
        "uri": "https://trust.acme-corp.com/reports/soc2.pdf",
        "digest": "sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f67890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

> **Note on `type`:** The `type` member is an open-text type identifier
> ([ADR 0014](https://github.com/Agent-Card/ai-catalog/blob/main/adr/0014-media-type-to-type.md));
> any string is accepted, with a recommended set of "known types." The
> known type for an MCP server referenced by its Server Card is
> `application/mcp-server-card+json`.

## MCP Servers as an AI Catalog

A domain that hosts remote MCP servers can publish them as an AI Catalog,
letting clients that understand `application/ai-catalog+json` discover
those servers alongside A2A agents, skills, and other artifacts. Each
entry points to a server's Server Card:

```json
{
  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "host": {
    "displayName": "Acme MCP Servers",
    "identifier": "did:web:acme-corp.com",
    "documentationUrl": "https://acme-corp.com/docs"
  },
  "entries": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme-corp.com:mcp:finance-server",
      "type": "application/mcp-server-card+json",
      "url": "https://api.acme-corp.com/finance/server-card",
      "tags": ["finance", "mcp"]
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme-corp.com:mcp:docs-search",
      "type": "application/mcp-server-card+json",
      "url": "https://api.acme-corp.com/docs-search/server-card",
      "tags": ["search", "docs"]
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:air:acme-corp.com:mcp:ci-cd",
      "type": "application/mcp-server-card+json",
      "url": "https://api.acme-corp.com/ci-cd/server-card",
      "tags": ["ci", "cd", "devops"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Decentralized Discovery

AI Catalog enables decentralized discovery: any domain can publish its
MCP servers at `/.well-known/ai-catalog.json` without registering with a
central authority.

A vendor hosting its own MCP servers can publish:

```
https://api.acme-corp.com/.well-known/ai-catalog.json
```

The catalog and the Server Card play two complementary roles: the
catalog is how a client *finds* a server's URL in the first place, and
the Server Card is the connection entry point it points at. They are
useful independently — a client that already knows a server's URL can
point at its Server Card directly, with no catalog traversal, while a
client starting from just a domain uses the catalog to enumerate what
that domain offers.

Because of this, there is no single prescribed discovery ordering.
Clients wire discovery in wherever it fits their architecture — probing
a domain's catalog when it enters a session, watching outbound traffic
at an egress boundary, or connecting to a known Server Card directly. A
typical catalog-first path is: fetch `/.well-known/ai-catalog.json`,
filter entries by `type` (`application/mcp-server-card+json`) to find
MCP servers, follow an entry's `url` to its Server Card for connection
details, and connect — evaluating the Trust Manifest (when present) for
publisher identity and attestations along the way. Whatever the path,
the Server Card is advisory: a client reconciles it against the live
connection and MUST NOT treat it as authoritative for access control —
the connection itself remains the source of truth. See the Server Card
[best-practices guidance](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/experimental-ext-server-card)
for the range of client integration strategies.

This separation lets AI Catalog provide the trust and cross-ecosystem
indexing layer while the MCP Server Card provides the protocol-specific
operational details. A domain with multiple MCP servers publishes one AI
Catalog listing all of them, with each entry pointing to its respective
Server Card.

## What AI Catalog Adds

A Server Card describes a single server but has no cross-server discovery
or trust layer. AI Catalog fills this gap:

1. **Publisher identity**: Verifiable publisher with DID or domain
   anchor.
2. **Trust verification**: Attestations (SOC2, HIPAA, publisher
   identity proofs) via the Trust Manifest.
3. **Provenance**: Links to source repositories, registries, and
   build artifacts with cryptographic digests.
4. **Signing**: Detached JWS signature on the Trust Manifest for
   integrity verification.
5. **Cross-ecosystem discovery**: MCP servers become discoverable
   alongside A2A agents, plugins, and datasets through a single
   catalog format.
6. **Composability**: MCP servers can be packaged with related
   artifacts (A2A agents, datasets) in nested catalogs.

# Mapping to Claude Code Plugins Marketplace

This appendix describes how the Anthropic Claude Code Plugins
marketplace format (see
[claude-plugins-official](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official))
maps to AI Catalog, enabling Claude Code plugins to be discovered,
indexed, and distributed through a unified catalog alongside other AI
artifacts.

## Overview

The Claude Code Plugins marketplace is defined by a `marketplace.json`
file that lists available plugins. Each plugin is a directory containing
a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` metadata file and optional components:
MCP server configurations (`.mcp.json`), slash commands (`commands/`),
agent definitions (`agents/`), and skill definitions (`skills/`).

```
marketplace.json                    # Top-level plugin directory
plugins/
  example-plugin/
    .claude-plugin/
      plugin.json                   # Plugin metadata (name, description, author)
    .mcp.json                       # MCP server config (optional)
    commands/                       # Slash commands (optional)
    agents/                         # Agent definitions (optional)
    skills/                         # Skill definitions (optional)
    README.md
```

## Conceptual Mapping

| Claude Plugins Marketplace | AI Catalog Equivalent |
|:---|:---|
| `marketplace.json` (whole file) | AI Catalog document (top-level) |
| Marketplace `name` | Catalog `host.displayName` |
| Marketplace `description` | Catalog `metadata.description` |
| Marketplace `owner` | Catalog `host` (with `identifier` derived from owner) |
| `plugins[]` array | Catalog `entries[]` array |
| Plugin `name` | Entry `identifier` (derived as URN); the plugin manifest carries its own name, so entry `displayName` is omitted |
| Plugin `description` | Entry `description` |
| Plugin `category` | Entry `tags[]` (first tag) |
| Plugin `tags` | Entry `tags[]` (merged with category) |
| Plugin `author` | Entry `publisher` |
| Plugin `source` (url, git-subdir, or path) | Entry `url` (pointing to the plugin repository) |
| Plugin `source.sha` | Entry `trustManifest.provenance[].sourceDigest` |
| Plugin `homepage` | Entry `metadata.homepage` |
| Plugin `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | The artifact content (referenced via `url`) |
| *(not in marketplace)* | Entry `trustManifest` (identity, attestations) |
| *(not in marketplace)* | Entry `type` |
| Centralized marketplace repo | AI Catalog (decentralized, any URL) |

## Source Types

The marketplace supports three source types for plugins. Each maps
differently to AI Catalog entry fields:

Direct URL source
: `{"source": "url", "url": "https://github.com/org/repo.git", "sha": "..."}`
  maps to entry `url` pointing at the repository, with `sha` captured
  as provenance digest.

Git subdirectory source
: `{"source": "git-subdir", "url": "org/repo", "path": "plugins/name", "ref": "main"}`
  maps to entry `url` constructed from the repository, path, and ref.

Local path source
: `"./plugins/name"` or `"./external_plugins/name"` maps to entry `url`
  pointing at the known repository location for the plugin directory.

## Marketplace as AI Catalog

The `marketplace.json` from
[claude-plugins-official](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official)
maps to an AI Catalog where each plugin is an entry:

```json
{
  "specVersion": "1.0",
  "host": {
    "displayName": "Claude Code Plugins Directory",
    "identifier": "did:web:anthropic.com",
    "documentationUrl": "https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins"
  },
  "entries": [
    {
      "identifier": "urn:claude-plugin:anthropic:agent-sdk-dev",
      "type": "application/vnd.anthropic.claude-plugin+json",
      "url": "https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/agent-sdk-dev",
      "description": "Development kit for working with the Claude Agent SDK",
      "tags": ["development"],
      "publisher": {
        "identifier": "did:web:anthropic.com",
        "displayName": "Anthropic"
      },
      "metadata": {
        "homepage": "https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-public/tree/main/plugins/agent-sdk-dev"
      }
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:claude-plugin:adspirer:ads-agent",
      "type": "application/vnd.anthropic.claude-plugin+json",
      "url": "https://github.com/amekala/adspirer-mcp-plugin.git",
      "description": "Cross-platform ad management for Google Ads, Meta Ads, TikTok Ads, and LinkedIn Ads.",
      "tags": ["productivity", "ads"],
      "metadata": {
        "homepage": "https://www.adspirer.com"
      },
      "trustManifest": {
        "identity": "urn:claude-plugin:adspirer:ads-agent",
        "provenance": [
          {
            "relation": "publishedFrom",
            "sourceId": "https://github.com/amekala/adspirer-mcp-plugin",
            "sourceDigest": "sha1:aa70dbdbbbb843e94a794c10c2b13f5dd66b5e40"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "identifier": "urn:claude-plugin:aikido:security",
      "type": "application/vnd.anthropic.claude-plugin+json",
      "url": "https://github.com/AikidoSec/aikido-claude-plugin.git",
      "description": "Aikido Security scanning — SAST, secrets, and IaC vulnerability detection.",
      "tags": ["security"],
      "publisher": {
        "identifier": "did:web:aikido.dev",
        "displayName": "Aikido Security"
      },
      "trustManifest": {
        "identity": "urn:claude-plugin:aikido:security",
        "provenance": [
          {
            "relation": "publishedFrom",
            "sourceId": "https://github.com/AikidoSec/aikido-claude-plugin",
            "sourceDigest": "sha1:d7fa8b8e192680d9a26c1a5dcaead7cf5cdb7139"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Plugin Packages as Nested Catalogs

A plugin that contains multiple components (MCP servers, skills,
commands, agents) naturally maps to a nested AI Catalog. This
mirrors the plugin directory structure where a single plugin
contains multiple artifact types:

```json
{
  "identifier": "urn:claude-plugin:anthropic:example-plugin",
  "displayName": "example-plugin",
  "type": "application/ai-catalog+json",
  "description": "Comprehensive plugin with commands, agents, skills, and MCP servers",
  "tags": ["development"],
  "publisher": {
    "identifier": "did:web:anthropic.com",
    "displayName": "Anthropic"
  },
  "data": {
    "specVersion": "1.0",
    "entries": [
      {
        "identifier": "urn:claude-plugin:anthropic:example-plugin:mcp",
        "type": "application/mcp-server-card+json",
        "url": "https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/blob/main/plugins/example-plugin/server-card.json"
      },
      {
        "identifier": "urn:claude-plugin:anthropic:example-plugin:skills",
        "displayName": "Example Plugin Skills",
        "type": "application/agent-skills+zip",
        "url": "https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/plugins/example-plugin/skills.zip"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## What AI Catalog Adds to the Marketplace

The `marketplace.json` format is a lightweight directory focused on
listing available plugins. AI Catalog extends this with:

1. **Trust and identity**: The marketplace has no signing, attestation,
   or publisher verification. Trust Manifests provide verifiable
   publisher identity and compliance metadata.

2. **Source integrity**: The marketplace includes optional `sha` fields
   on source references. AI Catalog formalizes this as provenance links
   with typed relations and cryptographic digests.

3. **Cross-ecosystem discovery**: Plugins become discoverable alongside
   MCP servers, A2A agents, and other artifacts through the standard
   `/.well-known/ai-catalog.json` convention — not only within Claude
   Code's `/plugin` system.

4. **Media type identification**: The marketplace does not type its
   plugins. AI Catalog assigns `application/vnd.anthropic.claude-plugin+json`
   enabling clients to filter and route by artifact type.

5. **Composability**: Plugin packages that combine skills, MCP servers,
   and commands can be represented as nested catalogs, making the
   internal structure of a plugin package explicit and independently
   addressable.

6. **Decentralized publishing**: Any domain can publish Claude Code
   plugins via AI Catalog without submitting to the centralized
   marketplace repository.
